///
///   R, p   -- the pose. What we actually want. The LiDAR constrains these.
///   v      -- VELOCITY. The IMU's dv residual relates v_j to v_i, so the solver needs
///             a variable to move. Loose coupling had no such variable and instead
///             finite-differenced velocity from the very poses it was helping produce
///             -- a feedback loop, and the origin of the constant-velocity runaway.
///   b_g,   -- BIASES. The preintegrated deltas were computed at some assumed bias. If
///   b_a       the truth differs, the deltas are wrong. Estimate them and we can shift
///             the deltas along their Jacobians instead of re-integrating.
///
/// Gravity is NOT a state here: it is fixed from the init window and held. (Estimating
/// it online is the natural next extension, and would make this 18-DoF.)
